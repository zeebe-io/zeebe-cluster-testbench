# Introduction and Goals

The _Zeebe Cluster Testbench_ is a tool to run end to end tests against Zeebe clusters.

## Requirements Overview

- It must be possible to run tests periodically
- It must be possible to run tests ad hoc
- It must be possible to run tests against a Zeebe cluster deployed in Camunda Cloud
- Clusters under test shall be created on demand and destroyed when it is no longer needed
- Engineers shall be notified when a test failure occurred
- The cluster in which a failure occurred must be kept alive until an engineer was able to analyse the failure

## Quality Goals

- The solution shall use hardware resources economically.
- The solution shall be able to scale with increased demand
- The solution shall require low maintenance in production
- The solution shall be fault tolerant to unavailability of external systems
- The solution shall automatically recover in case of failures.
- The solution shall be flexible to adapt to future needs.

# System Scope and Context

![System Scope](assets/system-context.svg "System context")

# Solution Strategy

The _Zeebe cluster testbench_ is basically a bunch of workers that request jobs from the _testbench_ test orchestration cluster.

The test orchestration cluster contains different processes that define the steps for a test. See [README.md](../README.md) for a documentation of the different processes.

Once a test is started, this will e.g. trigger the worker to create a cluster. Afterwards, another worker is triggered to run the test. Finally, other workers are triggered notify engineers (if needed) and destroy the cluster again.

The workers are stateless. The only state is kept by Zeebe in the _testbench_ test orchestration cluster. Workers exchange information by reading from and writing to variables in the process.

## Modules

- `core` - contains the launcher and the workers that are orchestrated by the test orchestration cluster
- `core/chaos-workers` - contains the worker to run chaos experiemnts (implemented in Bash)
- `cloud-client` - contains a server facade to interact with the Cloud API
- `internal-cloud-client` - contains a server facade to interact with the internal cloud backend. These services are not part of the official cloud API. They are accessed via a user account, not a service account.
- `testdriver-api` - contains interfaces and shared classes to be used by several test drivers
- `testdriver-sequential` - contains the workers for the sequential test

\*) all implemented in Java, unless otherwise indicated

## Service Task Reference

# Runtime View

Most of the runtime behavior is determined by the processes deployed to the _testbench_ cluster. See [README.md](../README.md) for a documentation of the different processes.

## Startup

1. Read all environment variables
2. Perform self test - the objective of the self test is to check connectivity to external systems; if these fail on startup, the application will not launch.
3. Deploy test orchestration processes
4. Register workers

## Fault Tolerance/Recovery

Fault tolerance and recovery are handled by the _testbench_ cluster:

- Whenever a task fails, it will be retried.
- If a worker dies, the job will time out and be reactivated.
- If the application crashes, all workers die. As soon as the application is back up, workers can poll for job again.

The _testbench_ cluster is deployed to a high availability cluster.

# Design Decisions

- Keep it simple - most workers are currently part of one deployment. This allows to start/manage all workers with a single deployment. However, it also allows for future scale out when several instances of each worker are needed.
- No framework (yet). Mostly to keep the dependencies to a minimum and not to commit on any architectural pattern too soon. (Given that the current implementation is mostly workers, a reactive, non-blocking IO framework would be ideal. However, it is questionable whether the load will ever get so high that the benefits of those frameworks materialize. CDI has been missed while implementing the current solution. So developer convenience might be a stronger driver for architectural commitment then technical criteria)
- All environment variables that are used by the solution are read out in the bootstrap class. Mostly because it gets opaque when environment variables are sprinkled throughout the code.
- Environment variables are currently the only way to configure the application
- Each Java worker defines its input and output parameters in dedicated classes. this is a little more verbose than necessary, but it also documents their interface.
- The communication to the _Cloud API_ and _Internal Cloud API_ uses RESTEasy Client API. This was the option with the least dependencies (in comparison to Spring RestTemplate, MicroProfile RestClient, and other)
- The chaos worker is implemented based on `zbctl`, which allows to forward jobs to bash scripts.

# Risks and Technical Debts

- Currently, there is no orderly shutdown. So far this has not caused any problems. However, it does slow the tests down when the application crashes or is restarted due to redeploys. The delay is due to Zeebe for the jobs to timeout before rescheduling new jobs.
- All Java workers share the same thread pool. If this thread pool dies or is blocked, then nothing will move forward.
- The chaos worker currently has only one instance. This can become a bottleneck when volume increases. Scaling it is not as trivial as just increasing the instance count. First, we need to find a way to correlate chaos experiment failures with the logs they produce.
- The application has no self monitoring. It relies heavily on Zeebe to restart jobs when things go wrong.
- The process to create a cluster has a potential infinite loop. If the cluster is created, but never gets ready, then the process will not terminate.
- The worker `MapNamesToUUIDsWorker` writes to the same variables that it uses as input. Once overwritten, it is no longer possible to look at what the input was. This already confused root cause analysis for a bug.
- The _CloudAPI_ might change and become incompatible. Diagnosing these problems is quite tricky with the RESTEasy Client API. It does a great job at giving developers a nice interface; however if a given REST endpoint returns e.g. a HTML page with a helpful human readable error message it is difficult to get a hold of this error message.
- The _Internal Cloud API_ might change and become incompatible. We are using a Camunda internal API here with no guarantees on backwards compatibility.
- The chaos worker is currently written in bash, which might be harder to maintain then other languages. The `zbctl` worker itself comes with some limitations, which we could overcome with other clients. Related issue [#110](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-cluster-testbench/issues/110)
