# Release Process

The release process is barebones and focused on what we need to use this tool internally.

## What we do

- Java artifacts are versioned according to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
- This version is considered to be the version of the entire project
- We publish released versions of the Java artifacts to Maven Central
- We tag the sources in GitHub with that version and create a release in GitHub that summarizes the changes

## What we don't do

- We do not adhere to any well-defined release schedule
- We do not assign versions to shell script workers
- We do not assign version numbers to individual Maven sub-projects
- We do not automatically check for API changes (meaning we might miss a breaking change and assign a wrong semantic version)
- We do not upload either the JAR or the shell script artifacts to GitHUb releases
- We do not publish Docker containers with either the JAR or the shell script artifacts to a public repository
- We do not adjust the images in the Kubernetes deployment descriptor files to reference the released version

## The Optimal Release Process

This section describes the optimal release process. It is here for future reference, and for interested parties who want to go beyond what is currently being provided.

## Relevant Release Artifacts

- JAR files for Testbench core and most of the testbench workers
- Maven POM files for Java sources
- Shell scripts for Chaos experiment worker
- Docker containers for Java and shell workers
- Kubernetes deployment descriptor files for Java and shell workers

## Build Sequence

- Run Maven `release:prepare` on Java sources
- Perform Maven release for Java sources
- Upload JARs to MavenCentral
- Build and publish testbench Docker container based on JARs
- Copy shell scripts for chaos experiments
- Build and publish choas worker Docker container based on chaos worker shell scripts
- Change versions in Kubernetes deployment descriptors to reference the correct versions of the Docker containers
- Commit changes of Kubernetes deployment descriptors
- Push changes to GitHub
- Create tag and release in GitHub
- Zip, checksum and add JARs to GitHub release
- Zip, checksum and add chaos experiment scripts to GitHub release
- Zip, checksum and add Kubernetes deployment descriptors to GitHub release
- Run Maven `release update-versions` command on Java sources
- Commit and push changes generated by Maven `release update-versions` command
